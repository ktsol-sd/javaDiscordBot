# modCheck
Basic discord bot with a few commands, including a music bot
Will revisit soon and make it actually useful, just wanted to mess around with JDA a bit. The commands that are currently implemented are:

!help - Shows all commands
!clear <integer> - Clears x messages
!kick <user> <reason> Kicks the user
!ban <user> <reason> Bans the user
!unban <userID> Unbans the user
!cooldown Testing how to add cooldown in commands
!test Testing how permissions work
!edit <channelID> <messageID> Edits your message to 'edited'
!restart Restarts the bot
!play <yt url> Joins the voice channel and plays the song.
  
  
  
To do list:
Fix permissions for commands like ban, kick, etc.
Add the option to queue playlists instead of 1 song
Add the ability to click on reactions and get assigned a role
Make a functional ticket system
